          <h4>CUAir - Cornell University Unmanned Air Systems</h4>
          <h5>Design and Operations Lead</h5>
          <h6>Feb 2017 - present</h6>
          <p>Who are we? A student-run team that works on the design, development, and testing of an unmanned aerial
            vehicle. We compete every year at the AUVSI-SUAS competition in Maryland which focuses on the creation of
            uavs for search and rescue purposes.</p>
          <p>The Design and Operations team works at the intersection of business and technology and esentially runs the
            project team simillar to a start up.</p>
          <p>My role on CUAir was initially being the Website, PR, and Outreach Lead where I recreated the website to
            reflect the project team's structure, works, and aircraft. Over the years I managed several fundraising
            campaigns such as Giving Day 2018 and Crowdfunding 2019 where we launch a massive campaign to get family,
            friends, alum, and companies to donate towards our cause so we can take our students to competition and fund
            (our now) 50-lb plane. Last year I redesigned the website with a better understanding of how to brand CUAir
            with a new focus on making the website data-driven because most of the information on our website is
            iterative: members, sponsors, previous aircrafts, alumni, etc and made most html generated by javascript and
            used libraries like jQuery and d3.</p>
          <p>Additionally, lead the Indigo project which is meant to automate and make the experience of sponsoring
            CUAir much more interactive and well managed.</p>
          <p>Currently, my role is to lead the Design and Operations team and ensuring that all projects involved with
            recruitment, front-end and full-stack development, graphics design, videography, photography, technical
            writing, marketing, and sponsorship relations is managed.</p>
